Blossom Interactive - a kinetic sculpture to raise awareness about hunger issues in Philadelphia

This sculpture is a 6 ft tall blossom which will be installed on Penn's campus in fall 2016. 
The blossom will feature a plaque with information about local hunger issues.
We are partnering with the local nonprofits Broad Street Ministry, Philabundance, Coalition Against Hunger, 
and The Food Trust to help to provide more publicity and increase their social media activity. 

"Let's talk hunger! Feed the conversation by posting a photo with #FeedBlossom to instagram or twitter"
When a pedestrian posts a photo of Blossom to Instagram and Twitter with #FeedBlossom the flower opens and changes
lighting colors to thanks the person for "watering" it. 

The code posted here is to connect to social media and set up webhooks that will talk with the 3G connected sculpture.
